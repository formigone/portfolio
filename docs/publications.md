After publishing a few demos and tutorials related to game development with JavaScript on YouTube and my legacy tech blog, I was approached by Packt Publishing inviting me to write a 300 page book teaching HTML5 to game developers.

A year after the release of my first book, Packt Publishing called me again with another book proposal. This time they wanted me to write a follow up to the first book, but now focusing on advanced game development concepts related to networking/multiplayer games.
