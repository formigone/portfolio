			<h3 class="editable">Blood Cholesterol Predictor (2018)</h3>
			<p class="editable">From a private dataset of images of blood samples with their accompanying cholesterol (in mg/dL), I developed several machine learning models that predicted one’s cholesterol from a picture of the blood sample. The best model ended up being a convolutional neural network using Google’s Inception 2 architecture.</p>
			<ul class="image-grid">
				<li>
					<img src="/images/cholesterol-predictor.png">
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="editable">The selected trained model was deployed to a server where it ran on a standalone Python process, fronted by an Apache API endpoint. I also developed an Android and iOS application that allows the user to use the phone’s camera to photograph their blood sample, use the API described, and get an accurate prediction within 1 second.</p>

			<ul style="color: #fff">
				<li>Used a private dataset.</li>
				<li>Developed custom tools in JavaScript and PHP to build a clean, labeled dataset from raw images.</li>
				<li>Developed, trained, debugged, and optimized multiple deep learning models.</li>

			<h3 class="editable">TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge (2017)</h3>
			<p class="editable">This was my first Kaggle competition, which I was surprised to place 222nd of 1315 participants (top 17%). The competition was sponsored by Google Brain, and consisted of having to train a machine learning model using a dataset of 64 thoursand 1 second audio files, each containing one of several commands (such as “up”, “down”, “yes”, “no”, etc.).</p>
			<p class="editable">Once trained, the model would be given thousands of new 1 second voice commands, and it would need to predict which, if any, of the commands the sound contained.</p>

			<h3 class="editable">Dfrag (2017)</h3>
			<p class="editable">A very minimalist JavaScript framework/abstraction to simplify creating DOM structures in a declarative way. The purpose of this was to simplify my own creation of JavaScript demos and prototypes without having to write a lot of code, and without having to setup React.js, Webpack, Babel, and all sorts of additional tooling just to render simple DOM elements on the page.</p>

			<h3 class="editable">php-config (2016)</h3>
			<p class="editable">A minimalist and loose port of node-config, which is a simple way to create environment specific configuration files. At run time, the configuration files from the various environemnts (local, development, stage, production, etc.) get merged in such a way that you can reuse configurations across environemnts, rather than copying and duplicating them.</p>
			<p class="editable">The reason for this project was to simplify configuration management in PHP projects, and to bring to PHP a very elegant solution that the Node package that this project mimics solved.</p>

			<h3 class="editable">Google’s Dev Art (2014)</h3>
			<p class="editable">Another competition I entered for fun. DevArt was a Google sponsored initiative where developers and artists were to develop art with code. The winner(s) would be given some cash grant to develop their idea more fully, and the final project would be featured in some museum somewhere in the world. Again, my intent was mostly to take place in this, learn, and have fun.</p>
			<p class="editable">My project was artsy rendition of Conway’s game of life, where the board was rendered by an image input by the user. Each generation of the game was rendered atop the previous one, but with some level of blending. The final output was intended to give the appearance of bacteria growing on a petri dish.</p>

			<h3 class="editable">php-chain (2013)</h3>
			<p class="editable">A thin abstraction over PHP’s native arrays to help you easily chain array transformation functions. The motivation for writing this library was because PHP’s array functions are ridiculous - APIs are not consistent, and you cannot chain or compose the functions. Performing back to back transformation opperations on arrays can be very verbose.</p>

			<p class="editable">This plugin looks for DOM elements containing a configurable className, then replaces that element’s contents (assuming it is source code) with extra DOM elements wrapping certain tokens parsed from the element, styling it such that it would render as highlighted source code.</p>
