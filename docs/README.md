## Adapted to my needs

This theme is great, and I thank the good folks that put it together. I've changed some of it to fit my needs, so my workflow is only:

 + Install dependencies (if this is the first time setting this up)

```
bundle install
```

 + Run local server

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
