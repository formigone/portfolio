I am a web engineer fascinated with artificial intelligence and machine learning, specialized in building large back-end and front-end systems.

# Open Source

The following are open source projects I've contributed to, either as a main contributor, or projects I've committed code to as an outsider.

## My own projects

**BigBrother.js** – visual user session tracking – mouse movement and scrolling recording and playback

**PHP Chain** – a thin abstraction over PHP arrays to help you easily chain array transformation functions
