title: A brief history of Rodrigo Silveira

---

I was born building complex HTML designs using tables. With time, I learned vanilla JavaScript, and later got addicted to jQuery. Soon I found my way into the backend of the web stack through PHP and MySQL.

During my early years as a web developer with PHP, I picked up Java from writing front-end <em>transpiled</em> JavaScript apps with Google's GWT. What an amazing experience this was. As an extension of that, I kept working with Java developing native Android applications.

Because of my passion for, and curiosity of technology, I started to focus my career on the data science path. Today I work on data and business intelligence, where I make sense of big data, and develop predictive machine learning models that add value to the business and improve the experience of our users.
