title: WebGL 101 Video Lessons and Tutorials
author: Rodrigo Silveira
---

Lately I've realized how much I miss doing 3D development. While at work the other day, I found myself listening to some old Google I/O videos about WebGL, and needless to say, I felt the great urge to jump right into some weekend project related to WebGL. Since it's been around a year since I last touched WebGL, I thought I'd start out slow, but ultimately put together something I could be proud of.

## WebGL 101 Video Lessons and Tutorials

This is what I decided to do: I'll write a terrain generator based on Minecraft (you know, the awesome looking blocky graphics). I'm thinking I'll just load the terrain and allow the user to move around it with the mouse and keyboard. The project is being hosted on Google Code (see link below), and you can find more information about the project there. As I make more progress on the project, I'll be posting my journey here on the blog.

Now, for those of you who want to learn more about WebGL, I'm posting some videos that I've watched in the past that I have found very useful. Enjoy.

## A WebGL instructional video by Erik Moller
This is a very long lesson by one of the best game developers I know. He goes into pretty good detail about the history of OpenGL, OpenGL ES, shaders, etc. I think this is a great introductory video because it's aimed to be just that. Erik goes through a series of progressive tutorials and examples, and explains the important parts as he goes along. This is definitely a must watch for any programmers wanting to get into game development and/or get a headfirst introduction to WebGL.

## WebGL Technique and Performance by Gregg Tavares (Google I/O 2011)

Since I'm already familiar with the 3D programming, I find this video a bit more useful. In this talk, Gregg goes over some very powerful optimization strategies for your HTML5 applications/games. While most tutorials on OpenGL, DirectX, or any other 3D engine out there, will teach you the basics and the obvious, I think it's a bit harder to find a quality presentation on the lesser common topic of optimization. Also a must watch for those of you who take your development seriously.
