At last, Packt Publishing has reached out to me and asked me to write a <a href="/learning-html5-creating-fun-games">follow up book to my previous one</a>. This time the book was about socket-based <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/multiplayer-game-development-html5">multiplayer game development in JavaScript</a>. Given the things I learned form writing the last book, it felt like this one was way, way easier to write. It also took me three less weeks to write it, although this book has fewer pages. Overall, it was a really great experience. I learned a lot, and had tons of fun. The folks at Packt are really fun to work with, and I definitely recommend it to anyone.
