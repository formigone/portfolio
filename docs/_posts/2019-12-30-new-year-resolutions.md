Once upon a time, I had a blog. That blog was primarily intended to be an online journal of my learnings, mostly stuff early on. Long story short, today I'm not interested in most of the early stuff I posted. Any random things I decide to post today, I'm finding myself posting it on a more popular platform, such as [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@formigone).

As today is just about the last day of the year 2019 (it's almost midnight as I type this), sounds appropriate to set a new goal for the new year (also, tonight I decided to revamp my Jekyll site, so it's all a new beginning here): clean up my professional blog, making it a place to post interesting R&D type demos. Any in-depth discussions will likely be posted on Medium due to the broader reach, and here I'll enjoy the freedom to post any JavaScript I choose.
