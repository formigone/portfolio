The purpose of my blog is to post unpolished, throwaway, R&D type stuff. The more in-depth discussions will generally be posted on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@formigone) and the posts here will contain more interactive demos. Below is a growing list of things I'm curious to try out and research more, as well as new ideas I come across.

## To do

 + Arxiv.org scraper
    + Following Jeff Dean's advice to read lots of paper abstract, I wrote a trivial API that queries arxiv.org and returns a list of abstracts for quick scanning. Now I need to post that code.
 + Genetic algorithms
    + I'm currently mostly curious about neuroevolution in general.
