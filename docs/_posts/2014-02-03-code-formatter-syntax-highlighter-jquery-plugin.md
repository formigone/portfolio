title: Code Formatter & Syntax Highlighter jQuery Plugin
author: Rodrigo Silveira

Today I decided to write a simple plugin to extend the functionality of everybody's favorite Javascript library: jQuery. The entire process only took around 20 minutes, so I won't be surprised if to find major bugs in it in the next few days. I did test the plug in a little bit, but I can't promise buglessness in this version.

## Code Formatter & Syntax Highlighter jQuery Plugin

All the plugin does is take source code that you write inside your HTML file, and format it with line numbers, and syntax highlighting. The highlighting part is styled through an external CSS file, which you can theme to your liking. Since I'm writing this in mid-December, I decided to style to resemble the Christmas season.
## How it works

Using the plugin is pretty simple: Import jQuery, my plugin (which I decided to call Rokko Code, after the great Brazilian coder), and the accompanying style sheet (or a custom style sheet if you prefer).

    <script type="text/javascript" src=" jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src=" rokkocode.js"></script>
    <link ref="stylesheet" href="rokkocode.css"/>

The next step is to identify where in your HTML you want the plugin to be applied. In this example, I'll write all my code inside a DIV tag with a class of â€œsrc_code".

    <div class="src_code">
    function Person(pName)
    {
         this.name = pName;
         this.greet = function()
         {
              return 'Hello. My name is ' + this.name + '.';
         };
    }
    </div>

Right now, if you look at your file, you should see something like this: 

    function Person(pName){
        this.name = pName;
        this.greet = function(){
            return 'Hello. My name is ' + this.name + '.'
        ;}
    ;}

Pretty boring, since you haven't called upon RokkoCode. So now the next step is to call the Rokko Code plugin on that DIV. If you have multiple elements that are matched in the jQuery expression, they will all be formatted.

    <script>$('src_code').rokkoCode();</script>

And the final result after the call to $().rokkoCode() is this:

    function Person(pName)
    {
         this.name = pName;
         this.greet = function()
         {
              return 'Hello. My name is ' + this.name + '.';
         };
    }

    var me = new Person('Rodrigo');
    alert( me.greet() );
