This is my first post from my phone, which I'm composing from the break room at work. I mainly just wanted to see how that would go. I downloaded the official WordPress Android app from the play store. While this has been easy enough, given JellyBean's auto correcting feature, I will still need to use my desktop in order to set up a few details about the post through some of the plugins I use.

Other than that, I might just start posting more often, especially while I ride the train to and from the office...
